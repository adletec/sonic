_sonic_ is a rapid evaluation engine for mathematical expressions. It can parse and evaluate strings containing
mathematical expressions.

_sonic_ is also the expression evaluator we use in our commercial products. It is a core component of our real-time
simulation tools for virtual vehicle and ADAS prototyping and is continuously stress tested in a demanding environment.
Its development and maintenance is funded by our product sales.

## Guiding Principles
The guiding principles for _sonic_ are (in that order):

1. **Performance**: _sonic_ is aiming to be the fastest expression evaluator for .NET. It is optimized for both, multi
   pass evaluation of the same expression and single pass evaluation of many different expressions.
2. **Usability**: _sonic_ is designed to be easy to use. It comes with a sane default configuration, an understandable
   documentation and a simple API. The most common use-cases should be fast out-of-the-box.
3. **Maintainability**: _sonic_ is designed to be easy to maintain. It is written in a clean and readable code style and
   comes with a comprehensive test and benchmarking suite. The NuGet package introduces no transient dependencies.

## Quick Start

_sonic_ can parse and evaluate strings containing mathematical expressions. These expressions may rely on variables,
which can be defined at runtime.

Consider this example:

```csharp
var expression = "var1*var2";

var variables = new Dictionary<string, double>();
variables.Add("var1", 2.5);
variables.Add("var2", 3.4);

var engine = Evaluator.CreateWithDefaults();
double result = engine.Evaluate(expression, variables); // 8.5
```

The Evaluator comes with out-of-the-box support for many arithmetic (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `...`),
trigonometric (`sin`, `cos`, `atan`, `...`) statistic (`avg`, `max`, `min`, `median`, `...`), and simple boolean
logic (`if`, `ifless`, `ifequal`, ...) functions.

You can add your own domain-specific functions. This example adds a conversion function from length in feet (`ft`) to
meter (`m`):

```csharp
var engine = Evaluator.Create()
    .AddFunction("ft2m", (Func<double, double>)((a) => a * 0.3048))
    .Build();
double result = engine.Evaluate("ft2m(30)"); // 9.144
```

You can find more examples below.

_sonic_ can execute formulas in two modes: **dynamic compilation mode** and **interpreted mode**. If **dynamic 
compilation mode** is used, _sonic_ will create a dynamic method at runtime and will generate the MSIL opcodes necessary
for the native execution of the evaluation. If a formula is re-evaluated with other variables, _sonic_ will take the
dynamically generated method from its cache (if enabled, which it is by default). Dynamic compilation mode is a lot
faster when evaluating an expression, but has a higher overhead when building the evaluator.

As a rule of thumb, you should use **dynamic compilation mode** if you are evaluating the same expressions multiple
times with different variables, and **interpreted mode** if you are evaluating many different expressions only once.

Additionally, for specific use-cases (e.g. Unity with IL2CPP) dynamic code generation can be limited. In those cases,
you can use the **interpreted mode** as a fallback.

### Migration from Jace.NET
_sonic_ originally started as a fork of [_Jace.NET_ by Pieter De Rycke](https://github.com/pieterderycke/Jace), which is
no longer actively maintained. It is not a drop-in replacement for _Jace.NET_, but you should be able to switch to
_sonic_ with little effort.

_sonic_ is **considerably faster** than _Jace.NET_ (see benchmarks below). It contains numerous **bugfixes** and a lot
of **maintenance work** over the latest _Jace.NET_ release (1.0.0). Many of them were originally suggested and developed
by the community for _Jace.NET_, but never merged due to the dormant state of the project. See the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) for
details and a complete list.

## Installation

_sonic_ is available via [nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Adletec.Sonic):

```bash
dotnet add package Adletec.Sonic --version 1.5.0
```

## Usage

### Evaluating an Expression

#### Directly Evaluate an Expression

The easiest way to evaluate an expression is to use the `Evaluate()`-method of the `Evaluator`:

```csharp
var expression = "var1*var2";

Dictionary<string, double> variables = new Dictionary<string, double>();
variables.Add("var1", 2.5);
variables.Add("var2", 3.4);

var engine = Evaluator.CreateWithDefaults();
double result = engine.Evaluate(expression, variables);
```

#### Create a Delegate for an Expression

_sonic_ can also create a [delegate (Func)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.func-2?view=net-7.0)
from your expression which will take the variable dictionary as argument:

```csharp
var expression = "var1+2/(3*otherVariable)";

var engine = Evaluator.CreateWithDefaults();
Func<Dictionary<string, double>, double> evaluate = engine.CreateDelegate(expression);

Dictionary<string, double> variables = new Dictionary<string, double>();
variables.Add("var1", 2);
variables.Add("otherVariable", 4.2);
	
double result = evaluate(variables);
```

If you intend to evaluate the same expression repeatedly with different variables, you should use this method. It will
avoid the overhead of retrieving the delegate from the cache, based on the expression string. On the other hand, there
is no performance benefit in using this method if you are only evaluating the expression once.

#### Handling Spaces and Special Characters

_sonic_ expects expressions to contain alpha-numeric characters and mathematical operators only.

However, it's possible to use single quotes (`'`) to wrap any symbol or function name, which will allow you to use arbitrary characters, including spaces, emojis, and even mathematical operators as part of your token name. 

> [!NOTE]
> There is no escaping mechanism for single quotes, i.e. you can't use single quotes in your token names.
> Apart from that, everything inside the single quotes will be treated as a black box, so every valid string is a valid token name.

Be aware that the quotation is not part of the token name, so `sin('x')` and `sin(x)` are equivalent. This also means that it's only necessary to use single quotes in the expression, not in the variable dictionary.

```csharp
var expression = "sin('x') + 'my variable'";
Dictionary<string, double> variables = new Dictionary<string, double>();
variables.Add("x", 0);
variables.Add("my variable", 3.4);
double result = engine.Evaluate(expression, variables); // 3.4
```

> [!CAUTION]
> You might want to use this feature to allow the usage of arbitrary token names from external sources in your application, e.g. from user input. Be aware that _sonic_ won't sanitize the input or token names in any way. This means that defining an expression with user defined token names (e.g. `var expression = $"1234 + '{tokenFromUserInput}'";`) will allow the user to inject arbitrary code into your expression.
>
> In other words, **don't use user input as token names, if you don't want them to manipulate your expression**.


### Using Mathematical Functions

You can also use mathematical functions in your expressions:

```csharp
var expression = "logn(var1,var2)+4";

Dictionary<string, double> variables = new Dictionary<string, double>();
variables.Add("var1", 2.5);
variables.Add("var2", 3.4);

var engine = Evaluator.CreateWithDefaults();
double result = engine.Evaluate(expression, variables);
```

The function names are reserved keywords and cannot be overwritten. If you need to override a function, you can globally
disable the built-in functions using the configuration (see below).

#### Custom Functions

You can define your own functions using the `.AddFunction()`-method while instantiating the evaluator.

```csharp
var engine = Evaluator.Create()
    .AddFunction("ft2m", (Func<double, double>)((a) => a * 0.3048))
    .Build();
double result = engine.Evaluate("ft2m(30)"); // 9.144
```

The `.AddFunction()`-method provides overloads for functions with up to 16 parameters. If you want to process an
arbitrary amount of parameters, you can use dynamic functions:

```csharp
double MyCustomSumFormula(params double[] a)
{
    return a.Sum();
}

var engine = Evaluator.Create()
    .AddFunction("customSum", MyCustomSumFormula)
    .Build();
double result = engine.Evaluate("customSum(1,2,3,4,5,6)"); // 21.0
```

Custom function names are overridable, so you can re-register the same name with a different implementation.

### Using Constants

_sonic_ provides support for pre-compile constants. These constants are taken into account during the optimization phase
of the compilation process. I.e., if your expression contains an operation like `2 * pi`, this operation is already
evaluated when you build a delegate and the result is cached.

#### Built-in Constants

| Constant | Name |
|----------|------|
| π        | `pi` |
| ⅇ        | `e`  |

The constant names are reserved keywords and cannot be overwritten. If you define a variable with the same name as a
constant, the constant will take precedence.

If you need to override a constant, you can globally disable the built-in constants using the configuration (see below).

#### Custom Constants

You can define your own constants using the `.AddConstant()`-method while instantiating the evaluator.

```csharp
var engine = Evaluator.Create()
    .AddConstant("g", 9.80665)
    .Build();
double result = engine.Evaluate("g*2"); // 19.6133
```

Custom constants will also be taken into account during the optimization phase of the compilation process.

### Validation

By default, _sonic_ will validate the given expression upon evaluation (`Evaluate()`-method) or delegate creation
(`CreateDelegate()`-method). This means that _sonic_ will check if the given expression is syntactically correct and
contains no unknown functions.

If the expression contains a syntax error, _sonic_ will throw a `ParseException`. If the expression contains an unknown
variable, _sonic_ will throw a `VariableNotDefinedException`.

#### Validate an Expression
If you want to validate an expression without evaluating it, you can use the `Validate()`-method of the `Evaluator`:

```csharp
var engine = Evaluator.CreateWithDefaults();
try {
  engine.Validate("var1*var2");
} catch (ParseException e) {
  // handle exception
}
```
This will validate the **syntax of the expression** and throw a `ParseException` if the expression is invalid.

#### Validate Variables
If you also want to check variable completeness without evaluating the expression, you can use the `Validate(string expression, IList<string> variables)`-overload:
  
  ```csharp
  var engine = Evaluator.CreateWithDefaults();
  try {
    engine.Validate("var1*var2", new List<string> { "var1", "var2" });
  } catch (VariableNotDefinedException e) {
    // handle exception
  } catch (ParseException e) {
    // handle exception
  }
  ```
This will validate **the completeness of the variables** and **the syntax of the expression** and throw a `VariableNotDefinedException` if the expression contains an unknown variable or a `ParseException` if the expression is invalid.

> [!NOTE]
> The decisive factor for variable completeness is not wether all variables referenced in the expression are defined, but wether all variables **necessary to evaluate the expression** are defined.
> The optimizer, if enabled (default), will pre-evaluate parts of the expression which do not depend on variables, including multiplications with `0` or `0`-exponents.
>
> Consider the example `var1 + 0 * var2`.
> If the optimizer is enabled, the expression will be pre-evaluated to `var1` and the expression will be valid even if `var2` is not defined. If the optimizer is disabled, the expression will be invalid if `var2` is not defined.
> 
> The Validate()-method will always behave like the Evaluate()-method in terms of the optimizer. If the optimizer is enabled, the expression will be pre-evaluated and the variables necessary to evaluate the expression will be checked. If the optimizer is disabled, the expression will be checked without pre-evaluation.
>
> However, the Validate()-method will **not** evaluate the expression, so it will be faster than the Evaluate()-method, if you don't need the result.


#### Parse Exception Types
The `Validate()`-method will throw a matching sub-type of [`ParseException`](https://github.com/adletec/sonic/blob/main/Adletec.Sonic/ParseException.cs) if the given expression is invalid.
Each exception contains a `Message`-property which contains a human-readable error message, and additional properties
which contain more detailed information about the error.

This is especially useful if you want to assist your users in writing valid expressions. You can use the information
contained in the exception to provide meaningful error messages or syntax highlighting.

The following exceptions are thrown by `Validate()`:

| Exception Type                           | Description                                                                                                        |
|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| InvalidTokenParseException               | Thrown if the expression contains an invalid or unexpected token (e.g. `var1*var2 var3`)                           |
| InvalidFloatingPointNumberParseException | Thrown if the expression contains an invalid floating point number (e.g. `var1*2.3.4`)                             |
| MissingLeftParenthesisParseException     | Thrown if the expression contains a closing parenthesis without a matching opening parenthesis (e.g. `var1*2)`)    |
| MissingRightParenthesisParseException    | Thrown if the expression contains an opening parenthesis without a matching closing parenthesis (e.g. `var1*(2+3`) |
| UnknownFunctionParseException            | Thrown if the expression contains an unknown function (e.g. `var1*unknownFunction(2+3)`)                           |
| InvalidArgumentCountParseException       | Thrown if the expression contains a function with an invalid number of arguments (e.g. `var1*sin(2;3)`)            |
| MissingOperandParseException             | Thrown if the expression contains an operator without operands (e.g. `var1*`)                                      |

You can find more details about the different exception types in the [source code](https://github.com/adletec/sonic/blob/main/Adletec.Sonic/ParseException.cs).

#### Disable Validation
If you don't want _sonic_ to validate the expression, you can disable validation globally using the configuration (see
below). This can slightly improve parsing performance. However, you should only do this if you are absolutely sure that
the given expression is valid (e.g. by validating it using the `Validate()`-method before).

A common use-case for disabling validation is when you are validating the expressions on user input. In that case, you
can avoid re-validating the expression upon evaluation.

In any case, validation is pretty fast. Don't expect a significant performance boost by disabling it or rewrite your
code to avoid validation, unless every millisecond counts.


### Guarded Mode
There are some cases in which _sonic_ can get ambiguous inputs. If there is no sane way to continue, _sonic_ will throw an Exception (see [Validation](#validation)).

Other ambiguous inputs are a little more subtle which makes them harder to find:

* A constant name collides with a function name
* A function name collides with a variable name
* The given variables include a variable name which is also a constant name
* A constant is defined multiple times with different values
* A function is defined multiple times with different implementations

_sonic_ doesn't automatically recognize those cases, since it's explicitly designed to have a sane default which doesn't require additional checks:

* Functions are always followed by an opening parenthesis, so they can be distinguished from constants/variables
* Constants always have precedence over variables
* Of two different constant definitions, the latter wins
* Of two different function definitions, the latter wins

However, all of those cases might be potential sources of error, so for some use-cases, it might not be the desired behavior to silently ignore the ambiguous input.

In that case, you can enable _Guarded Mode_ by calling `.EnableGuardedMode()` when building your `Evaluator` instance:

```csharp
var engine = Evaluator.Create()
    .EnableGuardedMode()
    .Build();
```

_sonic_ will then actively check if it encounters any of the above cases and throw an `ArgumentException` if it does.
These checks are pretty expensive, so _Guarded Mode_ is disabled by default. It is recommended to only use _Guarded Mode_ if performance is not of importance
or at least less important than the additional checks.

Still, _Guarded Mode_ can help you to find problems in your code which might otherwise be hard to track down. It can be beneficial to use it while developing an
application (e.g. in a _Debug_ configuration) and disable it in your production code (_Release_ configuration).

## Configuration

The `Evaluator`-builder also allows you to configure the evaluator. The following options are available:

| Option                                                   | Values (bold = default)                                                                                                                            | Comment                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

All options will be applied to the evaluator and all delegates created from it. The configuration is immutable. I.e., if
you want to change the configuration of an evaluator, you have to create a new one.

## Performance

### Benchmark

_sonic_ is primed to deliver great performance out-of-the-box. It comes with a comprehensive benchmarking suite which is
easy to run and understand.

You can use the benchmark to compare the performance of different configurations when evaluating specific expressions in
a specific way or environment.
The benchmark is based on [BenchmarkDotNet](https://benchmarkdotnet.org/).

To run the benchmark, you can use the following command:

```bash
dotnet run -c Release dotnet run -c Release --project Adletec.Sonic.Benchmark/Adletec.Sonic.Benchmark.csproj
```

Take a look at Program.cs to see how to extend or adjust the benchmark.

#### Comparison with other Libraries

To get a better understanding of the performance of _sonic_, the benchmark also includes a set of comparisons with other
popular expression evaluators for .NET.

**Disclaimer**: Keep in mind that all those libraries have unique features and performance is only one aspect when
choosing the right library for your project. The following comparison is in no way a statement towards the general
superiority/inferiority of any of the listed libraries.

##### Benchmark Setup

We're using a simple benchmark which will take the same three equations and evaluate them using the same values with all
libraries:

* Expression A - Simple expression `var1 + var2 * var3 / 2`
* Expression B - Balanced expression including functions and constants: `sin(var1) + cos(var2) + pi^2`
* Expression C - Foldable
  expression: `(var1 + var2 * var3 / 2) * 0 + 0 / (var1 + var2 * var3 / 2) + (var1 + var2 * var3 / 2)^0`

To make sure the expressions will be re-evaluated, we're incrementing each variable on every iteration.

The benchmark runs all iterations on the same machine (MacBook Pro 2021, M1 Max).

##### Benchmark Results

###### Default Settings

The following table shows the time in seconds it takes the benchmark to complete 100.000 evaluations of each expression
using the default settings of each library. As a reference, it also contains the time it takes to evaluate the same
expressions using hardcoded C#.

| Library      | Expression A | Expression B | Expression C |
|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------| 
| Hardcoded C# | 1.036 ms     | 1.029 ms     | 1.036 ms     |
| _sonic_      | 6.376 ms     | 9.145 ms     | 2.853 ms     |
| Jace.NET     | 22.637 ms    | 24.918 ms    | 29.710 ms    |
| NCalc        | 33.579 ms    | 51.400 ms    | 127.165 ms   |

Keep in mind that this is a very specific benchmark and not entirely fair. The frameworks are using different default
settings which might not be optimal for the given benchmark. You can get a better understanding of the performance of
each library by running the benchmark yourself and adjusting the expressions to your needs.

## Project Origin

When we originally forked _Jace.NET_, the idea was to give it a new home. At the time of writing, the upstream
repository still has 11 unmerged pull requests (which are mostly merged into _sonic_ now). It takes time and effort to
maintain an open source library, and we're very thankful for the fantastic foundation which is _Jace.NET_. Pieter De
Rycke's original code is still a very large part of _sonic_, and so is the work of all who have contributed to
_Jace.NET_ over the years.

However, as a company, using a software component which seems to be in a dormant state introduces a significant risk.
Our decision to create a maintained fork of _Jace.NET_ was mainly driven by the necessity to mitigate this risk, while
still using the best expression evaluator available for .NET.

While _Jace.NET_ is still the origin of this project, _sonic_ has diverged from its ancestor in quite some way,
including major changes to the API. These changes were - in part - necessary to fix some architectural problems we
encountered in the code base. Being able to add functions and constants after parsing and folding steps are completed
introduced a lot of headaches and complexity in the usage of _Jace.NET_ while adding almost no real world benefit over
doing the same steps before any evaluation has taken place.

It also showed that the _Jace.NET_ API evolved to its current state rather than following a clear design, which makes it
harder to understand: which of the three ways to evaluate an expression is the right one for a specific use case? How do
they differ at all?

After putting many hours of work into our _Jace.NET_ fork, we decided that it no longer made sense to maintain API
compatibility, and this was the birth hour of _sonic_.

When compared to _Jace.NET_, _sonic_ shows to be at least as fast as _Jace.NET_. Often, _sonic_ outperforms _Jace.NET_
by a significant factor, the notable exception being re-evaluation with disabled cache. This is due to a still existing
bug in _Jace.NET_ which prevents the user from _actually_ disabling the cache.

We're using _sonic_ in our commercial products and it's stress tested many thousand hours per year. We fixed a lot of
bugs, we're constantly benchmarking and testing new kinds of expressions to make sure that we don't overfit to a
specific kind of test.

The success of our products would not have been possible without the great work of Pieter De Rycke and the _Jace.NET_
community. Open sourcing _sonic_ and offering a new home to the _Jace.NET_ community is our way of giving back and to
say _Thank You_..

## Contributing

Your contributions are welcome. To streamline the process, take note of the following best practices:

* Always discuss your goal and solution in an issue before implementing a solution or even opening a pull request. This
  potentially saves a lot of time and rework compared to having the same conversation after you open your pull request.
* Do one thing (feature, bugfix, change,...) per pull request. If you need one thing to do another, break them up in
  separate requests.
* Please keep pull requests to a manageable size, so we can clearly understand the changes and intent.
* Add tests to prove your code is doing what it says and make sure there are no broken tests.
* Run the benchmark suite and make sure that your change didn't (negatively) impact performance. If so, clearly state
  why this is necessary.

## FAQ

**Q:** Why is the main project still on .NET Standard 2.0?<br/>
**A:** This is the [offically recommended](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard?tabs=net-standard-1-0#when-to-target-netx0-vs-netstandard) target version for reusable libraries aiming to maximimze compatibility. However, the build uses multi-targeting and is also targeting .NET6 directly, so there is no drawback for users on modern platforms.

**Q:** What is the purpose of demo application in the solution?<br/>
**A:** The original _Jace.NET_ contained a demo application just like this. It shows how an expression is parsed and
illustrates the AST derived from it. This is a cross-platform version of the same demo, built using Avalonia UI. It's a
nice little thing if you want to get a better understanding of what _sonic_ does internally. It's not a good example of
how to use _sonic_, though. If you want to see a lot of usage examples, take a look at the tests.
